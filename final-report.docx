My Approach and Methodolgy:
 - To find the number of records I used data.shape which gave me the number of rows and columns, the number of rows is the number of records.
 - To find the data types I used data.info().
 - To find the number of missing values I used data.isnull().sum().
 - I used a histplot to find the sentiment distribution.
 - I used a line graph to find sentiment trends over time.
 - I used a bar graph to find sentiment distribution with each sender.
 - I used a boxplot to find the distribution of message length with positive and negative messages.

Key Findings from EDA:
 - The number of records was 2191.
 - All the data types were objects.
 - There were no missing values.
 - There were more negative than positive messages.
 - The sentiment trends over time remained consistent.
 - Aside from johnny.palmer@enron.com all the senders had more negative than positive messages.
 - Positive messages tend to be shorter than negative messages.


Explanation of Employee Scoring and Ranking Processes:
 - After assigning a sentiment to each message, I used a funstion to assign a score to ach sentiment. Then I grouped all the scores by sender and summed them up to get the overall scores for each sender.

Flight Risk Identification Criteria and Outcomes:
 - Flight risks were senders who had 4 or more messages sent within a span of 30 days.
 - These are the senders that were considered flight risks: don.baughman@enron.com, rhonda.denton@enron.com, john.arnold@enron.com, patti.thompson@enron.com, johnny.palmer@enron.com, sally.beck@enron.com, bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com, eric.bass@enron.com, lydia.delgado@enron.com, kayne.coulter@enron.com

Overview and Evaluation of Predictive Model:
 - The predictive model wasnt very accurate as there doesnt seem to be a strong correlation between any of the features and the sentiment scores.
